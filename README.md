# RoboltPrototype Overview
This is an overview of my first Unity project, a 3D platform prototype created by me while I was attending a Game Production Master at Rainbow Academy of Rome. Made with Unity 2020.3.14f1 in HDPR, than upgraded to Unity 2022.3.16f1.

> [!NOTE]
> The project is public but it requires some paid assets from Unity Asset Store (not included in the repository)
